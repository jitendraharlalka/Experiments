This is a very humble experiment to consolidate discussion topics related to Nepal.
While twitter search API allows search query string to be ORed, it doesn't work with Devanagari text.

This script simply fetches recent search results by searching for following search terms:
"Nepal","Nepali","Kathmandu","Pokhara", "Chitwan","नेपाल","पोखरा","चितवन","काठमाडौं","काठमाण्डू"


ToDos:
- Post the status as retweets from a twitter account
- Reduce number of api calls by ORing the Roman search queries
- Eliminate duplicates from different calls

- The queries strings are limited and are static. Look for methods to couple them with dynamic topics identified by analysing tweets from Nepal (search by geolocation).
